# landing_page
Second TOP practice project!

This project involves making a landing homepage for a website. We are given the option to stray away a little bit from the design provided and use our own images if we desire, but I have chosen not to do this. I still am a little confused about css and flexbox so I would like to get it done as close to the original material as possible. Once I manage that, I will try for my own design in a future project!
